# C-SHARP-MINIPROJECT

## 1. Arithmetic Operations:
This program likely involves basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

## 2. Armstrong Numbers:
This program probably checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## 3. Substring of Strings:
This program is likely to find and manipulate substrings within a given string. It might involve operations like finding substrings, extracting substrings, or checking if a string contains a particular substring.

## 4.Divide By Zero Exception:
This program probably handles the scenario where division by zero occurs. It likely demonstrates how to use exception handling to gracefully manage such errors.

## 5. Pascal of a Triangle (Print Pattern):
This program likely prints Pascal's triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it.

## 6. Floyd's Triangle:
This program is expected to print Floyd's triangle, a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers.

## 7. Read and Copy a Text File:
This program likely reads the contents of a text file and copies them to another file, demonstrating file handling and input/output operations.

## 8. Implementation of Stack Operations:
This program probably implements basic stack operations such as push, pop, and display using arrays or linked lists.

## 9. Complex Numbers:
This program likely deals with complex numbers and performs operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on complex numbers.

## 10. Polymorphism Concepts:
This program probably demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming, showcasing how objects of different classes can be treated uniformly.

## 11.Abstract Class for Calculating the Perimeter:
As described earlier, this program involves designing an abstract class to calculate the perimeter of various geometric shapes, demonstrating concepts of abstraction and polymorphism.
